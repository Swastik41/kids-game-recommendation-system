Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed, but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although that's also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way. This is easily my favorite RE game (at least until 4 Remake comes out) and one of my top 5 games of all time, so you better believe that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.\", 'My entry point of the series (donâ€™t ask) this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and I had a fun time overall when playing this game and since Iâ€™m rating this out of pure nostalgia of Raccoon City and overall experience I think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game I got really bad luck with its rng of Mr X and some Lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made a somewhat of a stun lock move so I have to take out half a star but itâ€™s still worth playing since it is a very beautiful upgrade to the game I played as a kid and itâ€™s as good as I remember', 'A really well done vision of what survival horror games could be and a great remake of this beloved classic in general.', 'I dont have much to say but I really like this game.

True, it was a rocky road in some parts. Some of the later game areas obviously didnâ€™t get as much attention as the first half, and some bosses were pretty disappointing, and one was straight up bad. But everything else is excellent. Weighty, satisfying combat; incredible atmosphere; some of the best level design Iâ€™ve ever had the pleasure of exploring; incredibly deep lore that I absolutely did not fully understand, but I did my best; fun, memorable bosses,  and enemiesâ€¦ This game has it all, man.

Kill some people.\\n                     \\n                     Average F.E.A.R. mission: Walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people.\\n                     \\n                     Average Far Cry 3/4 mission: Drive across the world until you reach the location. Hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. Or sneak inside, I don\\'t care. This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.\\n                     \\n                     Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die, you can approach it a completely different way.\\n                     \\n                     This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their anti-air radar, and their electrical power. Don\\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\\n                     \\n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\\'s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.\\n                     \\n                     I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; there\\'s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu.\\n                     \\n                     These are small complaints, however, and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played. Since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, I heartily recommend buying it.\\n                     \\n                     One more thing: you can put your own music into the game to play through your Pokedex or on the helicopter. There\\'s nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while \"Back in Black\" blares through the stereo, or having your chopper play \"Born in the USA\" every time it picks you up.', \"Release the Kojima's cut\"]",

It is impressive how much they got right the first time though. This game doesn't feel like it's lacking much of anything besides a fast travel. I'm also shocked about how cool Samus's suit kept getting. I haven't seen any cosplay or drawings of that Phazon suit. It was a nice surprise.
